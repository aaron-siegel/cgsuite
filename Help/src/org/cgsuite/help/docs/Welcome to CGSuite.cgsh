Welcome to Combinatorial Game Suite!

If this is your first time using CGSuite, a good place to start is the [[Getting Started]] tutorial.

If you're familiar with beta versions of CGSuite (such as 0.7), you'll probably want to read through the tutorial too,
since a lot has changed.  There's also a <a href=\"What's New.html\">list of changes</a> since the prior release.
