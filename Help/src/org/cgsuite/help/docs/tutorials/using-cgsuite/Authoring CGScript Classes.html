<h2>Authoring CGScript Classes</h2>
<p>
In some of these files you might see expressions like

<p><code>java &quot;atomicWeight&quot;</code>

<p>These are the connection points where CGScript interfaces with Java, its host language.  You won't ordinarily need to
use the <code>java</code> keyword at all, unless you want to get involved in low-level CGSuite programming.  And I suspect that if
you're in that camp, then you'll be able to figure out the semantics of the <code>java</code> connectors on your own...<a name="Exercises"></a><h3> Exercises </h3>

<p><ol>
<li>Write a new class <code>PartizanSubtraction2</code> which is just like <code>examples.PartizanSubtraction</code>, but which takes a pair
of <em>procedures</em> f<sub>L and f</sub>R, enumerating the (possibly infinite) subtraction sets.  For example,

<p><code>PartizanSubtraction2(n -> n^2, n -> n*(n+1)/2, 10)</code>

<p>would construct a heap of size 10 in the game where Left can take a perfect-square number of tokens, and Right a
triangular number of tokens.  (You can assume that f<sub>L and f</sub>R are nondecreasing as functions of <em>n</em>.)
