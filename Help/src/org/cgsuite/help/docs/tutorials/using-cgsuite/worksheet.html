    <h3><a name="EnteringGames"></a>Entering Games</h3>

    <p>You can type games directly into the worksheet. For example, try entering the following:</p>

    <p><code>vv*2</code></p>

    <p>This represents the game double-down + *2. In general, you can enter combinations of ups, downs, and nimbers just as you'd expect.  The symbol <code>^</code> is used for up, <code>v</code> for down, and <code>*</code> for nimbers. To enter, say, 5 times up, you could type either <code>^^^^^</code> or <code>^5</code>.</p>
    
    <p>More complicated games can be entered using braces and slashes.  For example:</p>

    <p><code>{2||1|0,*}</code></p>

    <p>Expressions containing slashes <i>must</i> be enclosed in braces.  That is, to enter the game 1|0, you must type <code>{1|0}</code>.  Ambiguous expressions, such as <code>{1|0|-1}</code>, will be rejected; you'd need to enter <code>{1||0|-1}</code> or <code>{1|0||-1}</code> instead.</p>

    <p>Combinatorial Game Suite recognizes a wide variety of common games and 
    displays them using standard shorthand notation (such as +<sub>2</sub> for 
    tiny-two). Here's a few to try (make sure to enter each on a separate 
    line):</p>

    <p><code>{0||0|-2}<br>
    {0|v*}<br>
    {1,1+*|-1,-1+*}</code></p>

    <p>This tutorial contains many more examples of commands that you can enter 
    into the worksheet. If you're interested in seeing the results, but 
    you don't want to type everything in manually, you can copy-paste directly 
    from this tutorial into the worksheet. Simply highlight the command 
    with the mouse and select &quot;Copy&quot; from the Edit menu. Then click back 
    on the Worksheet and select &quot;Paste&quot; from the Edit menu. Make sure to 
    copy each command separately onto its own line of the Worksheet.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="OperationsOnGames"></a>Operations on Games</h3>

    <p>You can enter sums and products directly.  <code>*</code> is used for multiples.  For example:</p>

    <p><code>{3|2} + {2|0}<br>
    4 * {2||1|0}</code></p>
    
    <p>Note that <code>*</code> is used both for multiplication and to specify nimbers.  Observe the difference between
        these two expressions:</p>
    
<p><code>*2<br>
3*2</code></p>
    
    <p>Here <code>3*2</code> is equal to 6, <i>not</i> three-star-two.  For the latter, you'll need to type
        <code>3 + *2</code>.  Similarly, <code>3^2</code> is equal to 9 (exponentiation), not three-double-up.</p>

    <p>There are nine <i>comparison operators</i>: <code>&nbsp;==&nbsp; &lt;=&nbsp; &gt;=&nbsp; &lt;&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; !=&nbsp; &lt;|&nbsp; |&gt;&nbsp; &lt;&gt; </code>&nbsp;(Respectively: equals, less than or equal to, greater than or equal to, less than, greater than, not equal to, less than or confused with, greater than or confused with, confused with.)&nbsp; For example, try entering:</p>
    
<p><code>^^ > *<br>
0 &lt;| ^*</code></p>
    
    <p>You can assign variables as follows:</p>
    
    <p><code>g := {2||1|0}</code></p>
    
    <p>This assigns the value of <code>{2||1|0}</code> to the variable <code>g</code>, for later use in expressions
        such as (say) <code>g + ^*</code>.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="Objects" />Objects</h3>
    
    <p>In cgsuite, <i>everything</i> is an object.  You can access properties of objects with the &quot;dot operator&quot;.
        For example, with <code>g</code> as above, try typing some of the following commands (remember to type each on
        a separate line):</p>
    
<p><code>g.Mean<br>
g.Temperature<br>
g.LeftStop<br>
g.RightOptions<br>
g.Birthday<br>
g.Freeze</code></p>

    <p>In addition to properties, cgsuite supports various <i>method calls</i> on objects:</p>

    <p><code>g.Cool(1/2)</code>
        g.Heat(1)
        g.Thermograph.Plot()
    </code></p>
  
    <p>Always remember that <i>everything</i> is an object, including integers.  The following are all perfectly valid
    cgsuite expressions.</p>
    
    <p><code>4.Birthday<br>
            2.Tiny<br>
            (5/4).Floor<br>
            ^^*.AtomicWeight<br>
            ^.Pow(3)<br>
            {2||1|0}.Heat(1)<br>
            (g + {2|*}).Temperature</code></p>
            
    <p>You can also put several commands on the same line by separating them with semicolons, as the following example
        illustrates.  Output will only be generated for the last command on the line.</p>
    
    <p><code>g := {2|*}; h := g + {1|0}; h.Thermograph.Plot()</code></p>
    
    <h3><a name="CanonicalForms"></a>Classes and Canonical Forms</h3>
    
    <p>Every object in cgsuite belongs to a particular <i>class</i>.  For example, <code>3</code> is an <code>Integer</code>,
        <code>5/4</code> is a <code>Number</code> and <code>{2|*}</code> is a <code>CanonicalShortGame</code>.
        These classes are organized into a hierarchy, so (for example) every <code>Integer</code> is also a
        <code>Number</code>, and every <code>Number</code> is also a <code>CanonicalShortGame</code>.  An object's
        class determines what properties and methods are available to it.</p>
    
    <p>There are many other classes of objects in addition to the ones we've already seen.  The
        <code>CanonicalShortGame</code> class is itself a subclass of a more general class, <code>Game</code>.
        Other subclasses of <code>Game</code> are used to represent positions in specific games.  For example, there is
        a class called</p>
    
    <p><code>examples.Clobber</code></p>
    
    <p>which can be used to represent Clobber positions.  Try the following:</p>
    
    <p><code>g := examples.Clobber("xox|ox.")</code></p>
    
    <p>This constructs a 2x3 Clobber position with the layout you see on the worksheet.  To get the canonical form, type</p>
        
    <p><code>g.CanonicalForm</code></p>
    
    
    
    <h3><a name="Exercises"></a>Exercises</h3>
    
    <p>1. Let <code>G</code> be the game <code>{2||1|*}</code>. Calculate 
    the canonical forms of <code>G + G</code> and <code>G + G + G + G</code>. 
    Compute the mean and temperature of <code>G</code>. How does <code>G</code> 
    compare with <code>1</code> and <code>1*</code>?</p>
    
    <p>2. Use the <code>LeftOptions</code> and <code>RightOptions</code> 
    commands to determine the canonical form of <code>^5</code>.</p>
    
    <p>3. Let <code>H</code> be the canonical form of the 4x4 Domineering 
    rectangle that we calculated above. Try comparing <code>H</code> with 
    small positive and negative numbers. Make a conjecture as to whether 
    or not <code>H</code> is an infinitesimal, and then use <code>IsInfinitesimal(H)</code> 
    to verify it. How does <code>H</code> compare with various tinies?</p>
    
    <p>4. Heat <code>*6</code> by <code>1</code>. Note that only the first 
    few lines of the canonical form are displayed. Click on the &quot;More ...&quot; 
    button to display the full canonical form.</p>
    
    <p>5. Try to find constraints on positive numbers a, b, c (a &gt; b) such that <code>{a|b} + +<sub>c</sub> = {a+<sub>c</sub>|b+<sub>c</sub>}</code>.</p>
