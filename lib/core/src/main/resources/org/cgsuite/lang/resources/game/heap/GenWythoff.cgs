/** Ruleset schema for generalizations of [[Wythoff]].
  *
  * `GenWythoff(f)` is an impartial ruleset played on two heaps of tokens, parameterized by a
  * Fraenkel-Tanny ~bounding function~ `f`. From a position $(a,b)$, a player may either:
  * \ul
  * \li Remove any number of tokens from any one heap; or
  * \li Remove $k$ tokens from one heap and $l$ tokens from the other, provided that
  * $0 < k \&le; l < f(k)$.
  * \endul
  * This formulation (due to A. Fraenkel and Y. Tanny) subsumes various previously studied Wythoff
  * generalizations. In particular:
  * \ul
  * \li `GenWythoff(k -> k + 1)` is ordinary [[Wythoff]].
  * \li `GenWythoff(k -> k + r)` is Fraenkel's `r-Wythoff` (it is equivalent to the condition
  * $|k - l| < r$).
  * \endul
