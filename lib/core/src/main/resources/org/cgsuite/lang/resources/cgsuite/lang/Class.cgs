/** A CGScript class. Every class in CGScript has an associated
  * ~class object~, which is an instance of `Class` that exposes
  * various useful properties of the underlying class.
  *
  * There are two ways to obtain a class object in CGScript.
  * Entering a class name by itself returns its class object;
  * for example, from the Worksheet,
  *
  * \display{Nimber}
  *
  * returns the class object for [[Nimber]], and
  *
  * \display{Nimber.Name}
  *
  * returns its name as a [[String]]. Alternatively, you
  * can use the [[Object#Class][Class]] property of any object
  * to get its class object, e.g.,
  *
  * \display{*2.Class}
  *
  * also returns the class object for `Nimber`. This can be a
  * useful test for class equality:
  *
  * \display{*2.Class == Nimber}
  *
  * But beware! While the above test returns `true`, the following
  * will return `false`:
  *
  * \display{0.Class == Nimber}
  *
  * because $0$ belongs to the more specific class [[Zero]], not
  * `Nimber`. Therefore, this should be viewed as a test for
  * ~exact class identity~, not hierarchy.
  *
  * In this example, you can use the [[NormalValue#IsNimber][`IsNimber`]]
  * property for the desired test: `*2.IsNimber` and `0.IsNimber`
  * will both return `true`.
