/** A finite pseudonumber in canonical form.
  *
  * A ~~pseudonumber~~ is a stopper $P$ such that for every subposition $Q$ of $P$,
  *
  * $Q^L < Q^R$ for every $Q^L$ and $Q^R$.
  *
  * It can be shown that the only finite pseudonumbers are $on$, $off$, and games of the form $x$, $x + over$, or
  * $x + under$, where $x$ is a dyadic rational.
